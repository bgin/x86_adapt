Performance Event Select Register 0, \n[0:7] Event Select: Selects a performance event logic unit. \n[15:8] UMask: Qualifies the microarchitectural condition to detect on the selected event logic. \n[16] USR: Counts while in privilege level is not ring 0. \n[17] OS: Counts while in privilege level is ring 0. \n[18] Edge: Enables edge detection if set. \n[19] PC: enables pin control. \n[20] INT: enables interrupt on counter overflow. \n[21] AnyThread: When set to 1, it enables counting the associated event conditions occurring across all logical processors sharing a processor core. When set to 0, the counter only increments the associated event conditions occurring in the logical processor which programmed the MSR. \n[22] EN: enables the corresponding performance counter to commence counting when this bit is set. \n[23] INV: invert the CMASK. \n[31:24] CMASK: When CMASK is not zero, the corresponding performance counter increments each cycle if the event count is greater than or equal to the CMASK.
